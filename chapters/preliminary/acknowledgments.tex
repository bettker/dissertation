\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisors, Prof.~Dr. Andr{\'e} Grahl Pereira and Prof.~Dr. Marcus Ritt, for their guidance during the past two years. Their expertise and continuous feedback were invaluable to my research and significantly contributed to my growth as an academic and professional.
I would like to extend my gratitude to my research partner, Pedro Probst Minini, with whom I shared every moment of this master's degree. Without his contribution in our day-to-day work and countless discussions, everything would have been more arduous.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my mother, F{\'a}tima Antunes Vales, for her love and support throughout my entire life. I would not have reached this point without her unwavering dedication.
I would also like to thank my father, Roberto dos Reis Bettker, who I know continues to cheer me on from wherever he may be.
Lastly, I am grateful to those in my family who have closely followed my academic journey and offered their support and well wishes.
